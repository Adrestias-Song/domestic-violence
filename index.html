        <p class="drop-cap lead-graph">The steady <a href="assets/d1-5.docx">beat of killings</a> has remained a constant in South Carolina, even as domestic violence rates have tumbled <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=4536" target="_blank">64 percent</a> nationwide over the past two decades, according to an analysis of crime statistics by the newspaper. This blood has spilled in <a href="assets/d1-7.docs">every corner of the state</a>, from beach towns and mountain hamlets to farming villages and sprawling urban centers, cutting across racial, ethnic and economic lines.</p>
        <p>Consider 25-year-old Erica Olsen of Anderson, who was two months pregnant when her boyfriend stabbed her 25 times in front of her young daughter in October 2006. Or Andrenna Butler, 72, whose estranged husband drove from Pennsylvania to gun her down in her Newberry home last December. Or 30-year-old Dara Watson, whose fianc&eacute; shot her in the head at their Mount Pleasant home and dumped her in a Lowcountry forest in February 2012 before killing himself.</p>
        <p>Interviews with more than 100 victims, counselors, police, prosecutors and judges reveal an ingrained, multigenerational problem in South Carolina, where abusive behavior is passed down from parents to their children, from one age to the next. Yet the problem essentially remains a silent epidemic, a private matter that is seldom discussed outside the home until someone is seriously hurt.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We have the notion that what goes on between a couple is just between the couple and is none of our business,&rdquo; said 9th Circuit Solicitor Scarlett Wilson, chief prosecutor for Charleston and Berkeley counties. &ldquo;Where that analysis goes wrong is we have to remember that couple is training their little boy that this is how he treats women and training their little girl that this is what she should expect from her man. The cycle is just perpetual.&rdquo;</p>

        <h2>A lack of action</h2>
        <p>South Carolina is hardly alone in dealing with domestic violence. Nationwide, an <a href="assets/d1-11.pdf">average of three women</a> are killed by a current or former lover every day. Other states are moving forward with reform measures, but South Carolina has largely remained idle while its domestic murder rate consistently ranks among the nation&rsquo;s worst.</p>
        <p>Though state officials have long lamented the high death toll for women, lawmakers have put little money into prevention programs and have resisted efforts to toughen penalties for abusers. This past year alone, about a dozen measures to combat domestic violence died in the Legislature.</p>

        <p>The state&rsquo;s <a href="d1-12.docx">largest metro areas</a> of Greenville, Richland and Charleston counties lead the death tally in sheer numbers. But <a href="assets/d1-12.pdf">rural pockets</a>, such as Marlboro, Clarendon and Union counties, hold more danger because the odds are higher there that a woman will die from domestic violence. These are places where resources for victims of abuse are thin, a predicament the state has done little to address.</p>
        <p><a href="assets/d1-14.docx">All 46 counties</a> have at least one animal shelter to care for stray dogs and cats, but the state has just <a href="http://www.state.sc.us/dss/fv/" target="_blank">18 domestic violence shelters</a> to help women trying to escape abuse in the home. Experts say that just isn&rsquo;t enough in a state that records around <a href="assets/d1-16.doc">36,000 incidents</a> of domestic abuse every year. More than 380 victims were turned away from shelters around the state between 2012 and 2013 because they had no room, according to the state Department of Social Services.</p>

        <p>Oconee County, in South Carolina&rsquo;s rural northwest corner, realized it had a problem last year after six people died in six months in domestic killings. The sheriff pushed for the county to open a shelter after 58-year-old Gwendolyn Hiott was shot dead while trying to leave her husband, who then killed himself. She had nowhere to go, but the couple&rsquo;s 24 cats and dogs were taken to the local animal shelter to be fed and housed while waiting for adoption.</p>
        <p>When asked, most state legislators profess deep concern over domestic violence. Yet they maintain a legal system in which a man can earn five years in prison for <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/south-carolina/2012/title-47/chapter-1/section-47-1-40k" target="_blank">abusing his dog</a> but a maximum of just <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t16c025.php">30 days in jail</a> for beating his wife or girlfriend.</p>
        <p>Many states have harsher penalties. <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2010/title-97/3/97-3-7">Mississippi</a>, <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2919.25">Ohio</a> and <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-39/chapter-13/part-1/39-13-111">Tennessee</a>, for example, set the maximum jail stay for the same crime at six months. In <a href="http://law.onecle.com/georgia/16/16-5-23.1.html">Georgia</a> and <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/codeofalabama/1975/13A-6-130.htm">Alabama</> it is a year.</p>
        <p>This extra time behind bars not only serves as a deterrent but also can save lives, according to counselors, prosecutors and academics. <a href="assets/d1-25.pdf">Studies have shown that the risk</a> of being killed by an angry lover declines three months after separation and drops sharply after a year&rsquo;s time.</p>

        <h2>Wife beaters get lenient treatment</h2>

        <p>More than a third of those charged in South Carolina domestic killings over the past decade had at least one prior arrest for criminal domestic violence or assault. More than 70 percent of those people had multiple prior arrests on those charges, with one man alone charged with a dozen domestic assaults. The majority spent just days in jail as a result of those crimes.</p>
        <p>A prime example is <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20140530/PC16/140539957">Lee Dell Bradley</a>, a 59-year-old Summerville man accused of fatally stabbing his longtime girlfriend, Frances Lawrence, in late May. Despite two prior arrests for violating court orders meant to protect Lawrence, the longest Bradley ever stayed in jail for abusing women was 81 days. And that came only after he appeared before a judge on a domestic violence charge for the fifth time.</p>
        <p>Then there is 55-year-old <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20130903/PC16/130909945">David Reagan</a> of Charleston, who spent less than a year in jail total on three previous domestic violence convictions before he was charged with strangling a girlfriend in 2013 while awaiting trial on an earlier domestic violence charge involving the girlfriend.</p>

        <p>The Post and Courier investigation also found:</p>

        <p>Police and court resources vary wildly across the state. Larger cities, such as Charleston, generally have dedicated police units and special courts to deal with domestic violence. Most small towns do not, making it difficult to track abusers, catch signs of escalating violence and make services readily available to both victims and abusers.</p>
        <p>Accused killers are funneled into a state court system that struggles with overloaded dockets and depends on plea deals to push cases through. Of those convicted of domestic homicides since 2005, <a href="assets/d1-29.docx">nearly half pleaded</a> guilty to lesser charges that carry lighter sentences.</p>
        <p>Guns were the <a href="assets/d1-30.docx">weapon of choice</a> in seven out of every 10 domestic killings over the past decade, but South Carolina <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/billsearch.php?billnumbers=309&session=120&summary=B">lawmakers have blocked</a> efforts to keep firearms out of the hands of abusers. Unlike South Carolina, more than <a href="http://smartgunlaws.org/domestic-violence-firearms-policy-summary/">two-thirds</a> of all states bar batterers facing restraining orders from having firearms, and about half of those allow or require police to seize guns when they respond to domestic violence complaints.</p>
        <p>Abusers get out of jail quickly because of low bail requirements. Some states, including <a href="http://mnadv.org/lethality/">Maryland</a> and <a href="assets/d1-34.pdf">Connecticut</a>, screen domestic cases to determine which offenders pose the most danger to their victims. South Carolina doesn&rsquo;t do this.</p>
        <p>Domestic abusers often are diverted to anger-management programs rather than jail even though many experts agree that they don&rsquo;t work. In Charleston, authorities hauled one young man into court in March after he failed to complete his anger-management program. His excuse: He had missed his appointments because he had been jailed again for breaking into his girlfriend&rsquo;s home and beating her up.</p>
        <p>Victims are encouraged to seek orders of protection, but the orders lack teeth, and the state has no central means to alert police that an order exists. Take the case of 46-year-old Robert Irby, who still had the restraining order paperwork in his hand the day he confessed to stalking and killing his ex-girlfriend in Greer in 2010. He gunned her down outside her home the day after he learned about the order.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.ndvfri.org/teams/index.php">vast majority</a> of states have fatality-review teams in place that study domestic killings for patterns and lessons that can be used to prevent future violence. <a href="assets/d1-38.pdf">South Carolina is one of only nine states</a> without such a team.</p>

<p>Two years ago, Danielle Richardson poured out her heart in a book titled “God Heard My Cries: The Deliverance.”</p>

<p>She was 37 and had spent much of her adult life drugged, drunk or both to escape what she witnessed at 16.</p>

<p>In the early morning hours of June 18, 1991, her mother’s longtime boyfriend, Greatly Montgomery, stormed into their East Side Charleston home drunk and argumentative, the way he did many nights. He railed at Richardson’s mother and the blows began. Richardson heard her mother’s screams as she tumbled from furniture to wall. Her mother then crashed into Richardon’s bedroom, blood spewing from 38 stab wounds. Richardson pressed a sheet into one gaping wound, but blood still flowed.</p>

<p>Neighbors called 911 and held Montgomery until they arrived and hauled him to jail where he committed suicide a couple weeks later.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns pad-top">
<p>The trauma of that night stole the next 16 years of Richardson’s life. Then on July 15, 2007, she woke in pain and vomit and promised God she’d sober up and straighten out her life.</p>

<p>She stumbled a couple of times but eventually found the strength she needed at Ebenezer AME Church on Nassau Street not far from where her mother died.</p>

<p>Today, Richardson says she’s found happiness in motherhood and in God and church.</p>

<p>“I’m determined not to be in an unhealthy relationship ... ever,” she said. “I never want to see anybody carry that burden.”</p>

        <h2>Legislative death</h2>
        <p>Located in the heart of the Bible Belt, South Carolina is a deeply conservative state where men have ruled centuries. The state elected its first female governor four years ago, but men continue to dominate elected offices, judicial appointments and other seats of government and corporate power. In many respects, the state&rsquo;s power structure is a fraternity reluctant to challenge the notion that a man&rsquo;s home is his castle and what goes on there, stays there.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Some of this is rooted in this notion of women as property and maintaining the privacy of what goes on within the walls of the home,&rdquo; said state Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, an Orangeburg Democrat. &ldquo;And a lot of it has to do with this notion of gun rights as well. When all of those things are rolled into one, it tends to speak to why we rank so high in the number of fatalities.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Against this backdrop, it has often been difficult to get traction for spending more tax dollars for domestic violence programs and bolstering protections for the abused. The only state money spent on such programs comes from a sliver of proceeds from marriage license fees &mdash; a figure that has hovered for years at <a href="assets/d1-39.docx">around $800,000</a> for the entire state. That&rsquo;s just a tad more than lawmakers earmarked this year for improvements to <a href="assets/d1-40.pdf">a fish farm</a> in Colleton County. It equates to roughly $16 for each domestic violence victim.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Even as we have gone up in the number of murders and attempted murders over the years, that support has never changed,&rdquo; said Rebecca Williams-Agee, director of prevention and education for the S.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all wrapped up in the politics of this state and the stereotypes of domestic violence victims. Why does she stay? Why doesn&rsquo;t she pull herself up by her own bootstraps?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Alicia Alvarez put up with abuse for years before she got the courage to leave. The Charleston mother of two said abusers create an atmosphere that robs victims of confidence.</p>
        <p>Abusers don&rsquo;t begin by hitting or killing, Alvarez said. &ldquo;It begins with little criticisms, second-guessing everything you do. They get in your brain so that when they tell you, &lsquo;You are worthless,&rsquo; you believe it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Just a few months after South Carolina&rsquo;s most recent designation as the deadliest in the nation for women, the state&rsquo;s Legislature took up about <a href="assets/d1-42.xlsx">a dozen bills</a> aimed at toughening penalties for abusers, keeping guns out of their hands and keeping them away from their victims.</p>
        <p>The bills languished in committees and died, with the exception of a lone provision that aims to protect the welfare of <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess120_2013-2014/bills/3361.htm">family pets</a> left in the care of a person facing domestic abuse charges.</p>
        <p>Five of those measures got stuck in the <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/committeeinfo/senatejudiciary.php">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>, a panel stacked with lawyers. Its chairman is Larry Martin, a Republican from Pickens County, where nine domestic killings occurred over the past decade.</p>
        <p>Martin wasn&rsquo;t sure why the bills failed to advance, but he stressed that he is a strong supporter of measures to reduce domestic abuse. He said lawmakers had approved meaningful legislation on the topic in recent years and that the measures had a powerful impact, though he couldn&rsquo;t recall what those bills were.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I promise you there is no effort to hold anything up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are generally supportive of legislation that helps reduce the horrible statistics we have each year on domestic violence.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>If so, Cobb-Hunter hasn&rsquo;t seen it. She <a href="assets/d1-46.docx">pushed a proposal</a> to require abusers to surrender their firearms if convicted of domestic violence or facing a restraining order. The proposal went nowhere after running headlong into the state&rsquo;s powerful gun lobby in an election year, she said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You put those two things together and you see the results &mdash; nothing happens. But, at the same time, families are being destroyed by this violence. That shouldn&rsquo;t be acceptable to any of us.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>State Rep. Bakari Sellers&rsquo; <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess120_2013-2014/bills/4343.htm">proposal to stiffen penalties</a> for first-time domestic violence offenders met a similar fate. The Democrat from Denmark, who is running for lieutenant governor, said some of his fellow House Judiciary Committee members seemed more intent on blaming victims for staying in abusive relationships than in giving the bill a fair airing.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big issue statewide, but people were just indifferent,&rdquo; Sellers said. &ldquo;The sad part is that women will die.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>After calls to legislators from The Post and Courier oover the past couple of months, House Speaker Bobby Harrell contacted the newspaper to say he was disappointed the session had ended with no action on domestic violence reform. The Charleston Republican pledged to appoint an ad hoc committee, led by a female lawmaker, to study the issue prior to the next legislative session and chart a path for change.</p>
        <p>This time, he said, things will be different.</p>
        <p>Paulette Sullivan Moore, vice president of public policy for Washington, D.C.-based National Network to End Domestic Violence, said curbing domestic violence is possible with good laws and systems for protecting women. But South Carolina&rsquo;s lingering presence among the top states for domestic homicides shows the state isn&rsquo;t getting the job done, she said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;To be in the top 10 states for so many years is pretty significant,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think that says the state needs to take advantage of this opportunity to craft good policy and legislation to ensure that it is not failing half of its population.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>If history holds true, 30 more women will be dead by the end of the next legislative session in June 2015, when lawmakers have another chance to stem the violence.</p>

          Investigators with shovels, pitchforks and rakes search the Francis Marion National Forest in 2012, close to where Dara Watson’s SUV was found burning off Halfway Creek Road. The site is a mile east of the Guerins Bridge Road intersection. As the vehicle burned, Watson’s fiance, David Hedrick, was seen walking on the roadside. He was carrying a shovel.

        <h2>The thin line</h2>
        <p>Every year, people from across South Carolina gather at the Statehouse in Columbia to remember those killed in domestic violence, a somber ceremony marked by the reading of names and tolling of bells.</p>
        <p>Politicians, prosecutors and other advocates repeat calls for an end to the bloodshed and proclaim criminal domestic violence the state&rsquo;s No. 1 law enforcement priority.</p>
        <p>Poets, scholars and philosophers have long rhapsodized about the thin line separating love from hate, a delicate thread that, when bent, can fuel a ravenous passion for reckoning and retribution. All too often in South Carolina, this ends with women paying the ultimate price.</p>
        <p>That was the case just before Christmas 2011, when Avery Blandin, 49, stalked through the front of a Wal-Mart store in suburban Greenville County, seething with rage and carrying a 12-inch knife tucked into the waistband of his slacks.</p>
        <p>Built like a fireplug and prone to blowing his stack, Blandin marched into the bank inside the store where his wife Lilia worked and began shouting. He jerked her onto a table and pulled out his knife, stabbing her again and again. When she slumped to the floor, he stomped on her head and neck.</p>
        <p>Lilia died within the hour. She was 38.</p>
        <p>Blandin had used his wife as a punching bag for years. She had filed charges against him, sought orders of protection and slept in her car to keep him at bay. But none of that stopped him from making good on his threats to kill her that December day.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I loved her,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.wyff4.com/news/upstate-man-going-to-prison-for-stabbing-his-wife-to-death/22322966#!baTJ6N" target="_blank">Blandin told</a> an Upstate courtroom after pleading guilty to her murder. &ldquo;She was my wife, my best friend.&amp;rdquo;</p>
